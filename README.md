VBA_Challenge
## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Performing financial analysis using VBA Programming language on 2018 and 2017 Green Energy stocks.In this project, I refactored the previous subqueries that performed analysis on different stock tickers using nested loops and arrays. By introducing TickerIndex which contains four different arrays (Ticker, TotalVolume, TickerStartingPrices, TickerEndingPrices) we were able to reduce the amount of computations required for this subquery which resulted in lower time for computation.
